# Portfolio page. Project Page

## Recommendation is to use bootstrap on this project. The visual aesthetics of the page will be evaluated with the expectation of a bootstrap site. If you would rather not use bootstrap please be sure your own CSS skills can create a clean looking site. You are welcome to use a different CSS tool such as foundation. Simply understand this is expected to be a clean page.

## This will be what is referred to as a Single-Page site. This site should include the following:

### Minimum of three sections.

- A navbar with a navigation element for each section. *COMPLETE
- Clicking on the nav item should bring me to the section in question. *COMPLETE
- A footer section is not counted as one of the three sections however should be included *COMPLETE
- Include clickable items that will take the user to your social media items. Minimum of 2 should be there but feel free to include all your social media items. *COMPLETE
- Include an external link to your tribute page in some way.
